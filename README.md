### Objective
Develop a social networking website that represents a simplified version of Instagram. Its main purpose is to facilitate interaction between people despite the distance that separates them. 

### Project Description
Meeting and interacting with people is often very difficult due to the harsh time constraints present in modern society. This website allows users to efficiently meet and interact in the visual medium through pictures. Similarly-minded individuals can enrich their journey through life by the action of “following a user’s profile”, which allows to view each other’s profiles and discover others and their interests. Users can also post pictures with description and show appreciation of different life styles by leaving comments on other users’ pictures.   

### Core Features
- <b>Posting a picture</b> (with a text description)
